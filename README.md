# IBM-Project-Segment and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of toronto

In this project, we will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto. 


In the first project (Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto.ipynb) we download Toronto neighborhood data from a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto.  Then we scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format

In the second project (Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto_prat2.ipynb) we scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format exactly as we did in the first project. Once the data is in a structured format we will get tha latitiude and magnitude of toronto city to start clustring and exploring.

In the third project (Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto_final_project.ipynb) we will explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto using FourSquare. Then we start to explore the venues in the neighborhoods, and analyze each nneighborhoods and cluster them. Finally, we will visulaize the resulting clusters.
